dplyr functions:

    Pick observations by their values (filter()).
    Reorder the rows (arrange()).
    Pick variables by their names (select()).
    Create new variables with functions of existing variables (mutate()).
    Collapse many values down to a single summary (summarise()).
    
These can all be used in conjunction with group_by()
