# 1. Brainstorm as many ways as possible to select dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, and arr_delay from flights.
flights %>% select(dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay)
flights %>% select(starts_with("dep"), starts_with("arr"))

# Can't think of anything else right now.

# 2. What happens if you include the name of a variable multiple times in a select() call?
flights %>% select(dep_time, dep_time)  
# nothing - just still list once.

# 3. What does the one_of() function do? Why might it be helpful in conjunction with this vector?
  
vars <- c("year", "month", "day", "dep_delay", "arr_delay")

# I don't know.  Help says it is retired in favor of all_of() and any_of()
# I don't understand what these do from documentation

# 4. Does the result of running the following code surprise you? How do the select helpers deal with case by default? How can you change that default?
  
select(flights, contains("TIME"))
# yes, because I figure it would be case sensitive.  One could use regular expression if you want that.
# But, in a way this is nice and probably more want one wants.

# 5.6.7 Exercises
# 1. Brainstorm at least 5 different ways to assess the typical delay characteristics 
# of a group of flights. 
# Consider the following scenarios:
# A flight is 15 minutes early 50% of the time, and 15 minutes late 50% of the time.
 
# A flight is always 10 minutes late.
 
# A flight is 30 minutes early 50% of the time, and 30 minutes late 50% of the time.
 
# 99% of the time a flight is on time. 1% of the time itâ€™s 2 hours late.
# consistancy is important.  So problem with early 50% and late 50%.  But if smaller
# time like 15 minutes not so bad.  A flight always 10 minutes late would be the best
# of the above.  Even better than the 99% on time but 1% 2 hours late.
# Which is more important: arrival delay or departure delay?
#   
# Come up with another approach that will give you the same output as not_cancelled %>% count(dest) and not_cancelled %>% count(tailnum, wt = distance) (without using count()).
not_cancelled %>% count(dest)
# following gives same result without count
not_cancelled %>% group_by(dest) %>% summarise(n = n()) 

not_cancelled %>% count(tailnum, wt = distance)
# following gives same result without count.
not_cancelled %>% group_by(tailnum) %>% summarise(d = sum(distance))

# 3. Our definition of cancelled flights (is.na(dep_delay) | is.na(arr_delay) ) is slightly suboptimal. Why? Which is the most important column?
# if the flight is cancelled then both will be false.  but with | first is checked and 
# if false then second is also checked.  We could just check one.  arr_delay more important
# Check - dep_delay is more important - plane could had crashed. So to get cancelled 
# dep_delay

# 4. Look at the number of cancelled flights per day. Is there a pattern?
# Is the proportion of cancelled flights related to the average delay?

cancelled_per_day <- flights %>% group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  mutate(can = (is.na(dep_delay))) %>%
  summarise(n = n(), num_can = sum(can))
