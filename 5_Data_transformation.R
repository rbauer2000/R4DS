# Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)
flights %>% filter(dest == "IAH" | dest == "HOU")

# Were operated by United ("UA"), American ("AA"), or Delta ("DL")

# Departed in summer (July, August, and September)

# Arrived more than two hours late, but didnâ€™t leave late

# Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight

# 5.3.1. Exercises
# How could you use arrange() to sort all missing values to the start? (Hint: use is.na()).
df %>% arrange(!is.na(x))

# 5.4.1 Exercises

# 1. Brainstorm as many ways as possible to select dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, and arr_delay from flights.
flights %>% select(dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay)
flights %>% select(starts_with("dep"), starts_with("arr"))
flights %>% select(ends_with("time"), ends_with("delay")) # doesn't work since other fields end in time.
flights %>% select(-c(year, month, day, sched_dep_time, sched_arr_time, carrier,
                      flight, tailnum, origin, dest, air_time, distance, hour, minute,
                      time_hour)) # this is dumb way since more are removed than kept.
# Can't think of anything else right now.

# 2. What happens if you include the name of a variable multiple times in a select() call?
flights %>% select(dep_time, dep_time)  
nothing - just still list once.

# 3. What does the one_of() function do? Why might it be helpful in conjunction with this vector?
  
vars <- c("year", "month", "day", "dep_delay", "arr_delay")

# I don't know.  Help says it is retired in favor of all_of() and any_of()
# I don't understand what these do from documentation

# 4. Does the result of running the following code surprise you? How do the select helpers deal with case by default? How can you change that default?
  
select(flights, contains("TIME"))
# yes, because I figure it would be case sensitive.  One could use regular expression if you want that.
# But, in a way this is nice and probably more want one wants.

# 5.5 Add new variables with mutate()

  select(air_time, air_time_calc, arr_time, dep_time)

# 2. Compare dep_time, sched_dep_time, and dep_delay.
flights %>% select(dep_time, sched_dep_time, dep_delay)
# How would you expect those three numbers to be related?
# looks right: dep_time = sched_dep_time + dep_delay.  To check this have to convert to minute etc.
#   
# 3. Find the 10 most delayed flights using a ranking function.
# How do you want to handle ties? Carefully read the documentation for min_rank().
flights %>% mutate(rank = min_rank(dep_delay)) %>% select(flight, dep_delay, rank) %>%
